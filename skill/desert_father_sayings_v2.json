Now when the Bishop heard [of this] he set them aside and excommunicated them. Then those men, wishing to show that they had done what was good, said to one another, ' We have made ourselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, and this Bishop drives us out! Let us go and make a complaint against him to the head of our monasteries, that is, to the Bishop of Jerusalem '; and when they had gone to him they related to him the whole matter. Then the Bishop said to them, 'And I also set you aside and excommunicate you'; and being greatly grieved at this remark also they went to the Bishop of Antioch, and related the matter unto him, and he also drove them away with the same words. Then the two brothers said to each other, ' Let us go to the Patriarch of Rome, and he will avenge us and will take vengeance on all these [Bishops].' And having gone to the great Patriarch and Bishop of Rome, and made him to know their matter, and what the Bishop and Patriarch [of Antioch] had said to them, they said at length, ' We have come unto you because you are the head of them all. Then the Bishop of Rome also said to them, ' I also excommunicate you and excommunicate you will be. 'Then, not knowing what to do, they said to each other, ' All these men accept the persons each of the other, and each honours the other, because they are accustomed to assemble together at the Synods, but let us go to the holy man of God, Epiphanius, Bishop of Cyprus, because he is indeed a Bishop, and he does not accept the person of any man.' Now when they drew near to the city, it was revealed to Epiphanius concerning them, and he sent [a man] to meet them, and to say to them, ' you will not come into the city.' And when they came to themselves they repented, and said, ' In very truth we have sinned; with what can we justify ourselves? For, even supposing that the Bishop and the Patriarchs have excommunicated us in an unseemly manner, peradventure this man is a prophet besides, for behold, God has revealed to him concerning us beforehand ; let us then condemn ourselves in respect of everything which we have done.' Then when God, Who knows that which is in the hearts [of men] saw that they had in very truth condemned themselves, He worked upon the mind of Epiphanius so that, of his own accord, he sent and brought them, and associated them in communion with him. And he also wrote concerning them to the Bishop of Jerusalem, saying, ' Receive your sons, for they have repented in truth.'

But be you of good courage, O brother, and go back again to your cell, and make your entreaty to God as you repent, and He will establish you in your former grade.'

Questions and Answers on the Rule of Life of the Holy Men which they taught before the Multitude and in their Cells on every kind of Spiritual Excellence", "saying": "On one occasion the brothers saw that Abba Joseph was sad, and that he was greatly distressed, and they asked him to tell them about his sorrow, and what was the cause thereof, but he was unable to speak to them; and they began to say each man among them to his companion, ' What are the suffering and grief which possess the old man, for behold, we have dwelt with him for many years, and we never before saw him in such grief and suffering as this? Perhaps we have in some way offended him. ' Then they threw themselves on their faces before the feet of the old man, saying, Peradventure we have offended you in some matter, O father, [and if we have] forgive us for Jesus' sake.' And the old man made answer to them in a state of grief, saying, ' Forgive you me, O my brothers, for I am not offended by you, but I am grieved by myself, because I see that I am going backwards rather than forwards, and that I am the cause of offence and loss, not only to myself but also to all the others. For I see that at this present we are trafficking, and are losing in respect of our souls very much more than we ever gained at any time of the profit of the fear of our Lord, because shamelessness and fearlessness have gained dominion over us. For in times past when the fathers were gathered together to each other they were wont to form bands and ascend into the heavens, but we are lax folk, and are dead in our sins. Whensoever we draw near to each other we come to speak that which is hateful about one another, and one by one we are raised up that we may descend to the bottom of the deepest abyss. And we do not make to sink ourselves and each other only, but also the fathers who come to us, and the strangers who gather together to us, and also the people who are in the world who visit us as if we were solitary monks, and as if we were holy men, and to these last we become a cause of stumbling and loss. For thus also did Abba Sylvanus and Abba Lot say to me: 'Let us not abide here any longer.' And when I asked them, 'Why do you depart from us?' they spake to me as follows: 'Up to this day we have benefited by our abiding with the fathers, but from the time of Abba Pambo, and Abba Agathon, and Abba Petra, and Abba John, the commandments of the fathers have been held lightly, and we do not observe the ordinances and the laws which our fathers laid down for us. And by assemblies together we suffer loss over and over again through the useless things which are spoken among us. And when we sit down at table, instead of doing so in the fear of God, and with gratitude, and eating that which God has prepared for us with praise and thanksgiving, we occupy ourselves by conversing together and telling insipid stories; and as we sit at table in this fashion we become so much changed that we do not even hear what is being read to us on account of the noise of the profitless talk which we hold with each other. And besides this, after we have risen up from eating, we converse together with empty talk. What benefit is it to us to live in the desert, seeing that we profit nothing thereby? ' And Abba L6t said, ' Many times have I heard from brothers who are strangers, and from the people who live in the world, and who come to visit us, that we hold the commandments of the fathers lightly, and they have said of us, 'We should never have thought that they were monks!'' And one of the brothers who were strangers said, ' I have come to the fathers on several occasions, and [I see that] year by year they certainly observe less and less the early rules and conduct of the fathers.' What now do you wish? Will you correct your lax behaviour, and observe carefully the commandments of our fathers, or must I also depart from you?' And it came to pass that when the brothers heard these things, they beat the board for assembling the monks, and the whole brotherhood gathered itself together, and Abba Joseph spake to them all the words which are [written] above. And when all the brothers heard the words of Abba Joseph, and learned the reason of his pain and grief, and that he wished to depart from them, they cast themselves down upon their faces weeping, and they expressed their contrition to him, saying, 'Forgive us, O father, for the sake of Jesus. We have made God angry by our deeds, and we have caused your holiness grief.' Then each of the fathers said, ' Would that you hadst rebuked us on the very first day wherein you did hear [about us] from the fathers, and that they had not departed from us! And would, too, that we had roused ourselves up from our slumber and sluggishness! But what are we to do? For the old men and the holy men do not teach us, and they do not even take their proper places in our congregations, or when we sit at meat. Very many of us wish to hear the histories and commandments of the fathers read, either while we are sitting at table or between one sitting and the next, but we are never able to hear a word of their talk.' And Abba Elijah said, 'Abba Abraham and Abba John spake much at table, and at the time of reading, and at the time of the service; and they began to become excited against each other, and the one said, ' Father, such and such a man is excited, and the other said, ' Such and such a man makes us excited. ' Now when Abba Joseph saw that the whole brotherhood was stirred up, he made supplication to them, and besought them, saying, ' I beseech you, O my brothers, to cease from your commotion, for God has called us to peace, and I therefore beg you to come and pray, and to make supplication unto God that He may make to pass by us the legions and the host of the enemy. For, behold, I see them standing up in wrath and anger, with their swords drawn, and they wish to destroy us all if God does not stand up to help our wretchedness.' And when he had said these things he was able, with some difficulty, to quiet them, and Abba Joseph himself began to sing the words of the harpist David, saying, 'Their swords will enter their own hearts, and their bows will be broken, and God will make them like a wheel and as dust before the wind. And God will arise and all His enemies will be scattered. O God, deliver me, O Lord, remain to help [me]' (Psalm xxxvii, 15; lxxxiii, 13; lxviii, 1; vii, 1). And when they had recited the Psalms of the spirit altogether, and had made an end of the service, they said, ' O holy God, O holy mighty One, O immortal holy One, have mercy upon us'; and they all knelt down in prayer. And as they were praying they heard the voices of the devils in the air, and the sounds of armour and of horses, and of many horsemen, and they also heard the voices of the devils who were saying to one another, ' you will not have mercy upon them.' And again they said, 'O luckless monks, why do you stand up against us?' If we were to do [what we could do] to you not one of you would be found on the face of the earth! We will never be absent from you, and we will never cease from you.' And after the filthy legion had been driven away by the secret power, and the wicked devils rested from their wickednesses, all the fathers rose up from the earth whereon they had been poured out in prayer, the earth having been adorned by their tears, and they all offered repentance to Abba Joseph, saying, 'Forgive you us, and pray for us that the Lord may forgive us, for we have sinned and have provoked Him to wrath,' Then Abba Joseph said to them: 'Rouse yourselves, O my brothers, and take good heed to your souls, for, behold, you have heard with your ears the sound of the chariots of the Adversary, who threatens us and seeks to destroy us. Let every man be reconciled to his neighbour, and forgive you every man from his heart the offence [which he has committed]. And bind you yourselves with the love of our Lord, with an urgent mind, and a pure heart, to the Lord and to each other. And draw near to God that He may draw near to you, and stand up against the Adversary, who is Satan. If you will observe the commandments of the fathers, I will become a surety (or pledge) for you that Satan will not be able to injure you, and that the Barbarians will not come here; but if you will not observe them, believe me, O my beloved, this place will be laid waste.' And they offered repentance each to the other, and they became reconciled to each other, and lived in love and in great peace; and they laid down ordinances among themselves on that day to the effect that no man should henceforth conduct himself with negligence and without absence of fear; and that they should neither do nor say anything at the table which was alien [to their mode of life]; and that if any man be found hereafter despising and holding lightly the commandments of the fathers in such a way that he become an occasion of offence and a cause of loss, first to himself, and next to those who dwell with him, and then also to the strangers who come to us, he will know that he is bringing a punishment upon himself, and that he will become an alien to all the brotherhood. And Abba Joseph sent a brother to bring back Abba Sylvanus and Abba L6t, and when these fathers knew what had taken place among the brothers, and that they had laid down ordinances to keep the commandments of the fathers, they praised God, and they rose up, and came, and [when] they saw Abba Joseph they saluted him and wept; and Abba Joseph told them everything which had taken place, and they glorified God Who had not rejected those who feared Him. And as regards the canons and the ordinances which they had laid down among themselves, the brothers observed and performed them all the days of their life; and they died at a good old age, [after] living lives which were well-pleasing to God.", "saying_count": 250, "id": 871, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 15, "chapter_title": "Chapter 1.

Now there was in the prison-house a certain thief who had been a highway robber, and he was shut up [in a room] inside beyond them, and at that moment he happened to be sitting at a window which faced them, and he heard everything which they were saying; and with tears he said to himself, 'Woe is me! For although these people are in such great trouble, they are not willing to deliver over their freedom, and accept money, and go forth from this place, but they hold their chastity to be more valuable than riches. What then will I, the wretched one, do? For the thought that there is a God hath never entered my mind, and I never remember that my evil deeds will be judged, and I have committed many wickednesses, and many awful murders. And I know that when the judge comes here he will kill me without asking a question, as is just.' And he answered and said to the woman and her husband, ' Because I see that you preserve the purity of your bodies for Christ's sake, and that you have chosen to remain in great tribulation and not to destroy your chastity, God has put it into my heart to do to you an act of grace which you deserve, and perhaps God will show me mercy through you on the day of judgement. Go you to the northern side of the city wall, and dig there in a certain place, and behold, you will find there a large earthen pot, beneath which is a vessel full of gold. Take it, and pay your debt, and may a great blessing abide with you so that you may live upon it; but I beseech you to pray for me continually, that I may find mercy before God in the day of judgement.' And after three days the judge came to the city, and he ordered them to cut off the head of that thief without [asking any] questions, and after he had been slain, that noble woman said to her husband, 'Will you command me to go and see if that which the thief said is true?' And he said to her, 'Go.' And she went at the time of evening, and by the indications which the thief had given her, she found the place, and having dug a little she found the money, even as he had told her, and she took it and went to her house, giving thanks to God. And she brought it out little by little, and she gave it to the creditors, who thought that she brought it to them as the result of her begging, a little from here and a little from there; then when she had paid her husband's debt, he came forth from prison, thanking and glorifying God. Then Abba Joseph said to us, ' Behold these men, O my brothers! Because they chose to live in affliction, and refused to despise the command of God, God multiplied His grace to them without delay. For even if the woman had listened to that lascivious man he might not, perhaps,have given her what he promised her; but because they preserved their chastity which is pleasing to God, God rewarded her with the whole amount of their debts, and brought them to a greater state of prosperity than [that which they enjoyed] at first. And, my beloved, I think thus concerning Adam when he was in Paradise. Had he kept that little command, honour greater than that which he had at first would have come to him; but when he transgressed the command of his Lord, he fell from and was driven out of the delight and pleasure wherein he lived. May our Lord make us worthy to keep His commandments! Amen.'", "saying_count": 523, "id": 1144, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 15, "chapter_title": "Chapter 1.

Now he lacked food for the journey and the money which was necessary for his wants, and he knew not what to do; and when he had gone in to pray in the great temple of the Resurrection of our Lord, he prayed, and sat down in sorrow, and he was troubled about his departure, and the lack of that which he needed. And having sat down, he dropped into slumber, and slept, and he saw in his dream our Lord Jesus Christ, Who bade him be of good cheer, saying, ' Arise, be not sorrowful, but go in to the steward of My house of the Resurrection, and say to him, ' Jesus hath sent me to you so that you may give me the one dinar of which I am in need, and when He comes He will give it [back] to you for me.' Now when the monk had awoke from his sleep, he arose, and prayed first and believed the vision which had appeared to him, and he rose up and went to the steward [of the Church] of the Resurrection, as he had been commanded to do, and he spake to the steward, as he had been told in the vision. Then the steward said to him, When will Jesus come and repay me?' And the monk said unto him, 'I have told you what I have heard from Him, and as for you, you must do what you wish.' And the steward said to the monk, 'Give me a paper in your own handwriting' for the dinar, and take [it] and go'; and the monk sat down and wrote thus: 'I, John the monk, the stranger, from Antioch, a city of Syria, and from the holy monastery of Kawsyan hereby testify that I have received from the steward one dinar for food by the way, and I have, of mine own free will, set my handwriting thereto saying that when Jesus comes He will pay him for me.' And after the monk had taken the dinar and departed, the steward saw that same night in a vision of the night, that a man of splendid appearance came and said to him, 'Take the dinar which you gave to that monk, and give me the written paper which he gave you.' And the steward said in the vision, My Lord, the monk said to me, 'Jesus will come and repay me, and will take from you the paper which I have written.'' And the man said to the steward, 'I, even I, am Jesus; take your dinar, and give Me the writing which the monk gave you. Or, would you take anything more from him?' Then the steward took the dinar from Him, and he laid it in his hand, and gave Him the written paper, and He tore it up. Now when the steward awoke from his slumber he found the dinar in his hand, but the written paper had disappeared; and he marvelled and wondered, and praised God. Then he sent some of his people to bring back the monk wheresoever he might be found, and having gone they found him praying, and they said to him, 'Come with us; behold, the steward of the Church of the Resurrection seeks you.' And when the monk heard [this], he feared greatly, and said in his heart, Peradventure he wishes to take back the dinar'; and he went with them being troubled and sorrowful. Now when the steward saw him, he said to him, 'For the love of Christ I entreat you to eat with me this day,' and while they were eating, the steward said to him, 'What have you done with the dinar?' and the monk said, 'Behold, it is still with me.' The steward said to him, 'Mar Abba, take you as many dinar as you wish, only give me the paper which you did write [saying] that Jesus would come and repay me.'

Then the steward related to him that which had appeared to him, saying, 'The dinar has been paid back to me, and the paper which you did write has been taken by our Lord Jesus Christ from me'; and the steward entreated the monk, saying, 'Take from me, if you wish, ten pounds of gold, only write me [a paper, saying], Jesus will come and pay you for me,' and do you, my lord, depart in peace.'

He who takes care to keep these virtues will be able to be saved by the mercy of God and, to speak briefly, these are necessary for the man who seeks to live: Faith, and hope, and love, and love of God, and obedience, and humility, and patient endurance, and self-denial, and fasting, and constant prayer, and vigil, and service, and going into exile, and voluntary poverty, and absence of evil passions, and the silence of discretion, and deprivation of various meats. For if a man does not believe, he can neither hope nor love, nor have affection, nor be obedient; and if he be not obedient, he cannot either be humble, or endure patiently; and if he cannot endure patiently, he cannot practise self-denial, and if he cannot practice self-denial, he cannot draw near to fasting. And if he cannot fast, he cannot pray continually, and if he has no prayer, he cannot keep vigils; and if he keeps not vigil, service will not be found in him, for he will say and sing the service in a hurried manner. And he who possesses these things only in a little degree cannot go into exile and become voluntarily poor, and without the love of these things he cannot deprive himself of meats; and a man cannot acquire the silence of discretion when all these things are remote from him. Let us, then, take care to perfect; all these things in ourselves with all our might, through the help of God, to Whom be glory for ever and ever Amen.", "saying_count": 22, "id": 1211, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 17, "chapter_title": "Chapter 3.

Now therefore I have written down for you all these things so that your soul may not become sluggish, and so that you may not become the cause of [others] being like to you. And because of this I counsel you to take the yoke of pleasantness upon your neck, for it will help you to sit by yourself in silence, and to withdraw yourself from human intercourse, and from cares about the things of this world which will hinder you. And make yourself as the dust in [your] humility towards every man, knowing [at the same time] that there is hope [for you]. And let not weeping cease from your eyes, for there is the occasion of tears. And make your cell a hall of judgement of yourself, and a place for striving against devils and evil passions, and let there be depicted therein the kingdom [of heaven], and Gehenna, and death and life, and sinners and the righteous, and the fire which never is quenched, and the glory of the righteous, and the outer darkness, and the gnashing of the teeth, and the light of the righteous, and their joy in the Holy Spirit, and the Passion of our Lord, and the memorial of His Resurrection, and the redemption of creation. And let your habitation be free from superfluous things, for one of two things will happen unto you; either through thinking of them you will suffer injury, or in withdrawing yourself from them your war will be added to and become fiercer. And take heed lest, through [holding in] honour and sparing other folk, you bring yourself to evil case in the war; whatsoever belongs to lust and is of the eyes you will not possess, for the wars of your passions are sufficient for you. Heal you and make whole in your habitation those in whom God has pleasure; it is He Who knows your sitting down, and your coming in, and your going forth. And in all your conduct be constant in prayer, especially in the night seasons, for [night] is the acceptable time for prayer, as it is written, ' Be you like to your Lord, Who prayed to God continually throughout the night until the rising up of the Sun.' When all voices are quiet do you fill your mouth with praise, and your tongue with glorifying, and while others are lying like dead men on their biers do you depict in yourself the waking of the Resurrection. The night which is darkness to other folk will be to you bright as the day, and instead of filling yourself with wine as other men do, fill you yourself with the love of God; and in the night season, when silver and gold are stolen, do you steal the kingdom [of heaven] like a thief. In the night season, when sinners perform their evil deeds to their own injury, do you labour for the benefit of your own soul, and take care, continually of all excellences. Then He Who is merciful in His gifts, and rich to every one who calls upon Him, will come to you quickly and will help you, and you will smite the Evil One, and shalt bring to naught his crafty acts. And you will make your mind to shine, and the Lord of All will place in you the innocent thoughts of uprightness, and He will comfort your mind; then will the rugged ground become smooth before you, and the difficult ground will be as a plain, and your ship will anchor in [its] haven. And you will lead beforehand the life which is to come, and you will fulfil the Will of God, according to His Will, both in heaven and on earth; and your knowledge will grow and your joy increase in proportion to your spiritual conduct, and you will be held to be worthy of the sight of the righteous by the grace and mercy of Christ our Lord, to Whom, with His Father, and the Holy Ghost, be glory now, and always, and for ever and ever !

Questions and Answers on the Vision of the Mind", "saying": "An Admonition of Abba Mar John. Now you will not be able to find a more excellent way than this: He who would repent to Christ of his sins and follies must fall on his face many, many times, [and be sorry for] the sins which he has committed, and he must make supplication and entreaty to the mercy of God. Moreover, our other fathers have incited [us] to kneel down, and he who continually kneels down and prays rejoices in God. Woe is me, me the man of negligence! Now he who sighs, and weeps, and sheds tears in prayer, possesses all excellences together; for if we do not keep watch on and remember always our feebleness, while despising ourselves, and holding ourselves in contempt, the devils will lead us astray. Wake yourself up, O my beloved one, and keep in your remembrance always three moments, and forget them not; the first is the moment of death, with its sorrow, and grief, and trouble, which is immeasurable, that overtakes every man, when [a man will stand] before the awful throne of Christ; the second moment is the moment of fear and quaking when men and angels will rise up, when a man does not know what command will come forth concerning him, whether it will be for life everlasting or for torment everlasting; and the third moment is that when the penalty (or decree of doom) will come forth upon us, with its repentance of soul which will last for ever, and will be with us afterwards in the years which will have no end. At the [remembrance of] these three moments all men fear and quake; may God in His compassion save us from Gehenna and its endless torments ! Amen. I am an apostle, and I cast out devils, and I perform mighty deeds, but how am I to know that the end of Judas may not be mine, and how am I to know that I will [not] inherit hanging, and be called by our Lord 'Satan' and 'son of perdition'? If you see, moreover, a man who is a murderer, and a thief, and an adulterer, and a shedder of blood, you may think from where I will know [this]; for if this murderer at the end confesses Christ, he will precede me in the kingdom of heaven, and you will think thus concerning every man. If you, O man of God, wherever you go, think these and suchlike things continually, and if your humility be in proportion to the greatness of your power, you shalt never fall. But if a man be neglectful, even for the twinkling of an eye, of his humility, and if pride be mingled in his negligence, he will be cut off quickly from the height of the love of God, and he will fall, even as quickly as a glass vessel full of water, which is suspended by a thread of a spider's web, would fall if that thread were to be severed. Now the conduit of humility is thus. If at the beginning, or in the middle, or at the end, or wheresoever it may be, a man first of all lays hold upon perfect humility, and upon complete contempt of himself, the devils will be unable to approach him, on the contrary, they will flee before him, like flies before smoke, both they and their thoughts; but if a man [does not] acquire humility, either at the beginning, or in the middle, or at the end of his career, there is nothing which [can stand up] against the strife and contest. As the holy man Evagrius said, ' After the vanquishing of [all] the other passions, there still remain two which will wage war against the perfect man until death, namely, vainglory and pride.' And John, the seer of Thebais, used to say, 'He against whom the devil of vainglory still fights, wanders without measure, and is divided [in his mind] to a boundless degree. ' The Teacher used to say, 'Humility possesses two characteristics which are superior to the other excellences of the spirit, for it sees to what degree it can abase itself to the lowest depth, and grace also exalts humility to God, [and] to the height which is above; and because grace exalts it continually towards God, it acquires faith at all times, and strengthens confidence. And the second characteristic of humility is that it fears not that which opposes it, that is to say, it fears neither devils, nor wild animals, nor evil men, even as the holy man Evagrius said, ' The man who is proud and wrathful is a timid man, but the humble man is without fear.' And he said, 'Humility by itself vanquishes both passions and devils, and the labours of the body, and the contests of the mind only serve to strengthen 'humility the more. ''Therefore there is never a time when the monk has not need of humility. Now it is right for him that dwells in silence wishing to arrive speedily at purity of heart, and to take care of [his spiritual] splendour, to guard the three following things: \u2014 he must guard his hearing against listening to any word which may strike him and may rouse him up to anger; and he must guard his tongue, not only against rebuking and chiding any man, even though he be a man of no account whatsoever and a man of ignorance, and he must not [attempt] to teach or to admonish. But if a man ask him for a prayer, he must esteem himself to be the servant of him that asks him, and he must kneel down before the cross and say, ' O Lord, provide for my brothers according to your Will, and according to your design, and according as it may be beneficial for them before you, and make me, a sinner, worthy of your mercy through my prayers'; let him pray after this example, and it will suffice. Do not think in your mind, which may lead you astray, that you will be able to acquire even one spiritual excellence, no matter which it may be, without afflictions and troubles, whether with or without the desire; for no man who feeds his body daintily on lusts is able to enter through the door, even as the camel cannot go through the narrow hole of the needle. Now the pleasures of the body come into being because of unbelief, because the wretched body does not believe in those good things which are promised to the hungry, and in the woes which are prepared for those who are filled with food and who live delicately. Therefore he, who believes in the promises and threats, goes hungry, and he denies himself, and he watches in prayer, and he humbles himself, and he lays hold upon abstinence, and restrains himself from the gratification of his pleasures, and he inherits the purity which is promised to those who are blessed. But if he leads a life of sluggishness and pleasure, from it he will inherit the impurities and the punishments which are prepared for him in Gehenna. Now the desire of the Holy Spirit is thus: \u2014 Remoteness from the habitation of men, continual quiet, weeping and sorrowful cries, joyful hymns, the singing of the Psalms, and praises, fasting, and abstinence, and vigil, poor apparel, a humble gait, the cloaking of the thoughts of the passions, the hidden prayer of the mind; know you that such are the things in which those who are in the desire of the spirit wish to walk, and they never wish to perform the lusts of the flesh. And to speak briefly to you, O my brothers, fasting, and service, and standing up, and vigil, and abstinence from meats, are the constituent parts of a fair rule of life and conduct, and those who perform them will receive a reward from the true God if they perform them in truth, and if there be no alien pretence in their service. But listen, O my brothers, for this is the true work of the monastic life, the binding of the understanding which is in God, and the suppression of the alien thoughts which enter his heart; and whosoever has his heart [set] upon God acquires for his soul pleasure, and the life which is everlasting. Amen and Amen.

And one of the brothers divided his inheritance among the churches, and the monasteries, and the poor, and he himself became a monk, and he chose for himself a life of continual silence, and fasting, and prayer; now the other brother built a monastery for himself, and gathered brothers to him, and he took care of the strangers, and the poor, and the sick, whom he received and relieved. When the two brothers were dead there was questioning among the brothers about them, and they went to Abba Pambo and asked him, 'Which manner of life and conduct was the more excellent and exalted?' And having learned from God, he said to them, 'They are both perfect, and in my sight they appear to be of equal merit' Explain to us now the old man's words, for how can the man who is destitute, and the man who has possessions be equal [in merit]? The old man said, 'Since the whole conduct of these brothers was to God, and since whatsoever they did they did it for God, with an upright aim, and since the aim of each was the same, they appeared to be in the old man's opinion of equal merit before God.'", "saying_count": 0, "id": 1214, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers asked Abba Nastir, 'What rule of life and conduct should a man follow?'

Reveal to us now the mind of this holy man. And Abba Pambo said, 'If a man dwell in silence for God's sake, and not for the sake of vainglory, or any other human thing; and if another, who is sick, give thanks to God for his sickness, and he endure him that ministers to him with long-suffering, he becomes like to him that is in silence; and if he who ministers to men does it not for a reward of this world, but for God's sake, and if he constrains himself in everything, and does the will of those who are ministered to by him in love and gladness, he thus becomes like to him who shuts himself up in silence, and like to him that is sick, and in this way the work of all three is of equal merit. For Abba Joseph and Abba Poemen divided the perfect ascetic life into three classes, and therefore Abba Nastir said to that brother, ' If you conduit yourself according to any one of the three you shalt be perfect.' And this is well known from that which Abba Anthony said, ' Many have afflicted themselves with labours and tribulations, and because they had not in them the power of discernment, they did not know the way of truth.' And again he said, 'One man might live in a cell for a hundred years, and yet not know how to dwell therein [rightly] for one day, because he humbles not himself, and accounts not himself a sinner, and a feeble man, and ignorant, but he justifies himself, and blames others; nevertheless it is right that we should know that, even though some are sick, and others relieve the wants of men and minister to them with an upright aim, those who lead a life of silence lead a superior life, and follow a line of conduct which is more excellent than all the rules of life which are followed among brothers. And this life is superior in the same way that the Spirit of God is more exalted than the holy angels, according to what we have learned from the history of the holy men Abba Arsenius and Abba Moses the Ethiopian. For when one of the brothers went to the blessed Arsenius [to inquire of him] concerning the love of a silent life of contemplation, he neither set a table for him nor gave him refreshment; then he went to the blessed Abba Moses and he both welcomed him and gave him refreshment. And when one of the great fathers heard [this], he entreated our Lord to reveal to him this matter, saying, How is it that one flees for your Name's sake, and another welcomes and gives refreshment for your Name's sake?' And there appeared to him on the river two ships, in one of which were Abba Arsenius, and the Spirit of God Who was travelling along in silence, and in the other was Abba Moses, who was travelling with holy angels that were feeding him upon honey, with the comb thereof. And by this the fathers understood that the life of silent contemplation was as greatly exalted above alms and ministrations as was the conduct of Matthew the Evangelist above that of Zacchaeus the tax-gatherer.'' \u2022", "saying_count": 2, "id": 1216, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers said: The brothers asked Abba Pambo, saying, ' Supposing that a man who lives in the world has a wife and children, and supposing that he gives much alms, and sets free slaves, and redeems those in captivity, and visits the sick, and relieves those who are afflicted, and fulfills all the things which are proper for him [to fulfil], is not such a man equal in labour to one of the three classes of monks, that is, to the man that dwells in silence, or him that is sick, or him that ministers to the poor?' And the old man said, 'Not altogether.' And the brothers said, ' Wherefore?' And the old man said, ' Because, although the man who is in the world leads a life of righteousness, his whole conduct is outside the body, but all the labour of the monks is inside the body, that is, fasting, and prayer, and vigil, and hunger, and thirst, and the constraint of the will at every moment, and wars, both secret and manifest. And it is well known and manifest that the men, who are in the world and who are exceedingly excellent in their conduct, are not equal to the monks in their labours; for our Lord Jesus Christ surnamed the monks ' sons of light,' and those who are in the world  sons of the world. Now the monks with their members, and with their thoughts, and with their bodies, and with their conduct serve God perfectly with stern labours and afflictions, and they offer themselves up to God as a living, and rational, and holy sacrifice, with rational and spiritual service, and they are crucified to the world, and the world is crucified to them, according to the word of our Lord, Who said, 'Whosoever wishes to come after Me, let him take up his cross, and follow Me,' that is to say, Let him not fulfil his own will, but let him do My will only, and bear tribulations of all kinds. And monks will leave father, and mother, and brothers, and sisters, and kinsfolk, and country, and in return for these they will receive a hundredfold, and will inherit everlasting life. And to the men who are in the world, He said, ' Acquire for yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, so that when it has come to an end they may receive you into their everlasting habitations.  For as men who are in the world receive monks into their houses, so will the monks receive those who have lived in the world into the kingdom of heaven; and by this our Lord showed that all the good things of God and His kingdom belong to the monks who, from their youth even to their old age, have laboured to God in the excellent works of the ascetic and monastic life. But it is right that we should know to what degree the soul is superior to the body. The life which is led by the monks in silent contemplation, and the works thereof, are as much superior to the life which is led by righteous men in the world, as the life and conduct of the angels are superior to those of men. And the life and conduct of the monks are superior to those of men who are in the world, because the latter please God because of their love for men, while the monks do so because of their love for God.'", "saying_count": 3, "id": 1217, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers said, 'Into how many orders have the fathers arranged the monastic life?'

And he said, In whatsoever work of the fear of God the soul [is engaged], provided that the soul has due care, its mind is with God.' What is the meaning of the action of which the old man spake?' The old man said, 'He calls [a man's] care concerning God's promises ' action of the fear of God, ' wishing to say thus : \u2014 If you are unable to bind your thought continually in various ways to God, though you think about His Majesty, and His power, and His grace, and you pray to Him without ceasing and without wandering [in your prayer, your mind cannot be with Him]; but if you reduce your understanding by means of the constant labour of prayer and by the thought which is on God, and more particularly through the war with devils that [accompanies] this work, bring down your mind by degrees from the thought which is about God, and from prayer, and fetter it with the thought which is lower than this, and meditate on the promises of God, and think upon His commandments and the correction of yourself. And set not free your mind from spiritual care, and do not make it wander and think the thought of passibility, but fetter your mind to some thought of excellence, which will make it gain profit. And when it has rested somewhat, then raise it up on high, and make it to labour in the thought which is of God, and in pure prayer which has no wandering therein. For as the growth of the capacity of those who are as yet in the grade of bodily prayer and the reading [of the Scriptures] still existeth, even when they are exhausted by standing up, and by the singing of the Psalms, and they rest their bodies for a little by sitting down and by meditation upon the reading, and when they have rested their bodies and their mind has become enlightened through the reading, they stand up for service and prayer, so also it is right for those who have arrived at a correct conduct of the mind, and who think continually about God, and who pray to Him without wandering, when they are exhausted by this severe labour, to bring down their minds from time to time, and to relieve it by means of thought concerning some profitable subject which is less exalted than the thought about God. And this thought must take the place to them of reading, and they must meditate upon God's promises and commandments, and upon their straightness which is in God'; and if some abominable thought knock [at the door of their minds] they must quickly make their minds to enter into prayer and into the thought which is upon God. And if there stir in their heart a thought of passion, as soon as they have refreshed themselves by means of thinking about some profitable subject, they must make their mind to enter into the height of prayer, and they must pray without ceasing, and meditate upon God. And from this we know that when the soul meditates with understanding upon some profitable subject, or upon some profitable action, its mind is with God, even as the blessed man Diodes said. Similarly, whensoever a monk thinks about the passions of sin, or about deeds connected with the world, his mind is with Satan.'", "saying_count": 9, "id": 1223, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers said, ' Why is it that the Divine Light did not shine in the hearts of all the monks until a long time after they had been cleansed by labours and contests?

The old man said, ' Whensoever this light rises in its order in the hearts of men, according to what the fathers say, it comes in this wise. First of all Divine Grace makes a man hot with the love of God, and he hates all the glories and honours of this world; and next he comes in a state of poverty to this rule of life, and Divine Grace itself first gives him the love of labours, and it makes the things which are hard easy to him. And it protects him from the fierce attacks of the war of devils, so that they may not, whensoever they wish and will, assault him, but only according to his strength, and his capacity, and as is convenient for his growth. And thus after many labours and contests, his heart is purified with abundant humility, and he shines with the light of grace, and he is held to be worthy to see Christ in a revelation of light. And the fathers also said, that in proportion as the monk himself travels along the path of ascetic excellences to meet our Lord by means of labours and contests, so does our Lord advance to meet him with light until they meet each other, and then the monk remains in our Lord by means of labours, and our Lord remains in him by means of his light, even as Abba Isaiah said in his interpretation of that which our Lord said, ' Remain in Me and I in you.' Thus you see, O my brother, that He wishes us to remain in him first of all by the labours of righteousness, and then He will remain Himself in us in purity and in light.

The old man said, ' Because at the beginning Abba Moses was ignorant of the rule of the ascetic life, and because he was healthy of body, he worked overmuch, and he thought that he would be able to prevail mightily against devils by the multitude of his works alone, and that he would be able to vanquish them. Therefore, because the devils perceived his object, they attacked him more severely with frequent wars, both secretly and openly, but Abba Isidore, wishing to teach him the truth, and to make him to acquire humility, said to him, ' Without the power of the Spirit which our Lord gave us in baptism for the fulfilling of His commandments, the which is confirmed in us each day by the taking of His Body and Blood, we cannot be purified from the passions, and we cannot vanquish devils, and we cannot perform the works of spiritual excellence'; thereupon Abba Moses learned these things, and his thoughts were humbled, and he partook of the Holy Mysteries, and the devils were conquered, and they reduced their war against him, and from that time forward he lived in rest, and knowledge, and peace. Many monks have imagined that their passions would be healed, and that they would acquire soundness of soul merely by their labours and strenuousness, and therefore they were abandoned by grace, and fell from the truth. For as he who is sick in his body cannot be healed without the physician and medicines, however much he may watch and fast during the time he is taking the medicine, so he who is sick in his soul through the passions of sin, without Christ, the Physician of souls, and without the partaking of His Body and Blood, and the power which is hidden in His commandments, and the humility which is like to His, cannot be healed of his passions, and cannot receive a perfect cure. Therefore, whosoever fights against the passions and the devils by the commandments of our Lord is healed of the sickness of the passions, and acquires health of soul, and is delivered from the crafts of the devils.'", "saying_count": 11, "id": 1225, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers said, 'With what object did those two monks say to Abba Macarius, 'If you are not able to become a monk like us, sit in your cell, and weep for your sins, and thus you will be like us?'

And when the brothers entreated him to go in and rest with them, he said, ( Before I find the possessions of my house which I have lost I cannot endure being under a roof; for thieves fell upon me on the sea, and a storm reared itself up against me, and I have been robbed of the riches which I once possessed, and from being a man of high estate I am become of no account.' Now what were the riches which [he inherited] from his parents and lost? And what does this [story] mean? Who are parents? What does he refer to by the words 'sea, and storms, and waves'?

The word 'sea' he applies to the sea of the mind whereon the monk sails with works of spiritual excellence, wherefrom he enters the haven of impassibility, even as the blessed Macarius said, 'He who wishes to cleave the sea of the mind, makes himself long-suffering.' And he calls temptations 'storms,' and the passions 'waves,' and the 'thieves' are devils, and his 'parents' are the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, One God, in Whose image and likeness we are made, even as our Creator said, 'Come, let us make man in our image and likeness,' and also as our Lord said, ' Be you like to your Father, Who is in heaven.' And He calls the spiritual excellences, which contain likenesses of the similitude of our Father, Who is in heaven, and which make us heirs of God, and sons of the inheritance of Jesus Christ, by the name of ' riches and possessions of his parents,' and these are faith, and hope, and the love of God and man, and joy, and rest, and peace, and graciousness, and pleasantness, and lowliness, and humility, and long-suffering, and patient endurance, and integrity, and simplicity, and purity, and mercy, and cleanness of heart, and the holy light of the mind, and pure prayer, and the divine light which rises on the heart at the hour of prayer, and spiritual prayer, and Divine knowledge, and the visions and revelations of our Lord. These are the possessions of the soul, some of which it acquires naturally, and some by Divine Grace; now those which it acquires naturally are they which the Creator sowed in its nature at the beginning of its creation, and those which it acquires by Divine Grace are they which are bestowed upon it by the baptism in Christ. And these possessions are lost to a man through pleasures, and honours, and lusts, and benefits, but they are found and acquired, and the soul waxes rich in them, through tribulations, and revilings, and oppression, and hardships. Now although Abba Bessarion, and men who were as perfect as he was, possessed these things, other men lack them and are strangers to them.

These are the nine spiritual excellences which he possessed, and by means of them he vanquished all passions. By poverty he overcame the love of money. By abstinence he conquered unbridled appetite and gluttony. By fasting he overcame the passion of the love of the belly. By vigil he vanquished sleep. By the recital of the Psalms he did away idleness. By reading he kept away the converse of evil. By lowliness he dispelled wrath and anger. By humility he overcame vainglory and pride. By love of man he conquered hatred, and spite, and enmity. Now the spiritual excellence which he lacked, and which is the tenth, was the constant fervour of the love of God, which is in our Lord Jesus Christ, and this can [only] be gathered together, and established and acquired by the secret prayer of the mind, which is unceasing and wanders not, and by the strict and constant suppression of the thoughts of the passions, and the incitements of devils, when they first begin to bestir themselves in the heart. And because among all the works of ascetic excellence there is none more difficult [to do] than this, for, even as the blessed Macarius said, ' All the fightings and fierce, and crafty, and evil temptations of the devils are set in array against it,' the holy man is not able easily to become perfect in the love of Christ, which is acquired by the concentration of the mind and by deep thought about God. Therefore the blessed Evagrius said, ' If you can overcome the wandering of the thoughts, it is the end of all ends; and if you can make deep thought about God have dominion in you, you can overcome all passions, and you will be worthy of the perfection of the love of Christ. ' By the love of man and by the other virtues a monk may, by the help of God, vanquish all the passions; but by the love of Christ he will conquer the evil passion of the love of the soul, which is the first of all the passions, and which embraces them all, even as Saint Evagrius said, ' The first of all the passions is the thought of the love of the soul, and after it come the following eight.' And again he said, 'Conquer the strife of the love of the soul which is in your bosom, by that which is towards God.' For until the monk is worthy of this love, he is unable to acquire exact consolation from the remainder of the labours of the other spiritual excellences, even though it be that he obtains assistance from them, as Abba Isaiah said, 'Although the children of Leah were a help to Jacob, yet he loved Joseph most of all, and when Joseph was born, he wished to leave Laban and go to his parents, that is to say, When a monk has become worthy, and has acquired the perfect love of Christ, which is established by silent contemplation, and the power to pray without ceasing, and his soul is at all times rejoicing and exulting with gladness, he will not be content to remain in this life; but each and every day he will be desiring eagerly and longing to depart from the body, and to be with our Lord in Paradise, which is the habitation of the spirits of just men who have become perfect, and the holy country which is exalted above the passions, and devils, and the striving of those who cultivate the virtues until the revelation of our Lord Jesus, Who loves to make perfect a man with the never-ending happiness of His love in a glorious kingdom.'", "saying_count": 27, "id": 1241, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers said, 'Explain to us the course of life and labour of the old man [who made] baskets, [and dropped] small stones in them.' The old man said, 'The course of life of that old man was one which was of the mind, and it was stern, and excellent, and it swiftly brought the monk unto purity of heart. And as concerning that which he said, I set two baskets, one on my right hand and one on my left,' etc. it does not [mean] that he sat the whole day with his baskets round him, but that his two baskets were set in two places. And he himself was occupied with service and prayer, and with his toil, and for every thought, good or bad, which entered his mind he cast a pebble [into the baskets], that is to say, the labour is very severe for the man for a certain time at the beginning, because the devils are envious at the purity of heart which is acquired by him, and therefore they afflicted this old man also for a long time with the multitude of evil thoughts which were stirring in him, even as he said, ' Many days I have eaten nothing, because the good thoughts did not outnumber the bad ones.' Now he used to afflict his body with the labour of much fasting, so that he might do away the evil thoughts, because it is not the soul only which feels the labours of the body, its counterpart through its union with it, but also those devils which wage war against the soul, and they feel the labours of the body more than does the soul. For immediately the devils see the monk afflicting his body with labours, they become afraid, and stagger about, because they are more tormented by the labours than is the man who is engaged in them. Therefore the blessed Evagrius, when the demon of fornication assailed him, stripped off his tunic and stood the whole night long, in the season of winter, under the open sky, and by these means he made the demon to suffer pain, and he fled from him. And again, when the demon of blasphemy attacked him, he stood naked under the open sky, in the season of winter, for forty days. And because the thought of gluttony stirred in the heart of Abba Zeno, and made him to eat a cucumber by stealth, he crucified his soul in the sun, during the season of summer for five days. In this wise the holy men were afflicting themselves with labours and tribulations, and when the devils were stirring up in them the thoughts of sin, the demons were afflicted and tortured far more than they thereby. Now the demons were afflicted and tormented by the labours of the patient endurance of the monks not only in their minds but in their persons, through the operation of the holy angels, and by the command of God, even as, on one occasion, one of the devils was tortured the whole night in the cell of those two brothers who were brothers naturally, when he wished to separate them from each other. For when the younger brother lighted a lamp the devil threw down the candlestick, and extinguished the light, whereupon the [elder] brother smote him [on] the cheek; and the other brother expressed his contrition, and said, 'My brother, have patience, and I will light the lamp [again].' And when God saw the patient endurance and humility of the young man, He commanded His angel, and he fettered the devil the whole night long in their cell; and the devil was tormented therein until the morning because of that [blow on] the cheek which he made the one brother to suffer from the other through his wicked agency; and that wicked devil was fettered and tortured the whole night long. And the devils are tortured not only when we afflict our bodies with labours, in order that we may not consent to the will of devils, but also when they stir up in us evil thoughts; if we constrain ourselves a little, and cast them from us, at the same time calling our Lord to our assistance, straightway the holy angels which cleave to us will constrain the demons, and will drive them away from us, and we will be full of light, and of fervour, and of gladness.Even as one of the demons said to Abba Pachomius,A certain monk, against whom I wage war, is very strenuousand whensoever I draw near to him to sow evil thoughts in him,he betakes himself to prayer, and I,though burning with fire, have to depart from his presenceblazing even like iron which has been thoroughly wellheated in the fire.' Now monks are, at the beginning afflicted for a long time, not only by the stirring up of the evil thoughts themselves, but also by theirtarrying in the heart; but after a known time aman receives strength from our Lord, through their tarrying,and also after a known time their motion is restrained, and thenthe monk also has rest from strivings, and he is held to be worthyof purity of heart. For at the beginning of the strivingsthe devils stir up evil thoughts in the heat mightily;sometimes, however, these are destroyed through prayer atthe very beginning of their movement, and sometimes theyremain. And afterwards the mind becomes strong againstthem, and does not permit them to tarry altogetherin the heart, but it is as yet unable torestrain their violent movement, and the [tribulation whichthey cause], even as one of the old men said, 'I carriedon a strife for twenty years in orderthat an evil thought might not enter my heart, anduntil the ninth hour I used to see Satan with his bow drawnto shoot an arrow into my heart. And when he found noopportunity of doing this, he would become dejected and goaway ashamed each day.' Now the old man held fastto his rule in respect of the baskets, and thoughhe was afflicted for a long time by the motion ofevil thoughts, and sometimes even by their tarrying in his heart, finally he received power over their tarrying only,for their rising up remained for a considerable time. And havinglaboured n striving for twenty years against the motionof the thoughts, finally he became strong, and he overcame them.And the devils fled from him, an he arrived at a stateof purity, and at the haven of impassibility, and he was heldto be worthy of revelations.", "saying_count": 28, "id": 1242, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers said, 'If the holy men themselves afflictthemselves with labours of tribulation because of the tarryingof the evil thoughts which bestir themselves in them, and if they sin against God though not consentingto them, why should we toil against the notion of the devils?For behold even as the blessed Evagrius said, 'Whether theyfight against us or not the matter is not in our hands.''The old man said, 'The perfection of the monks arises froma spiritual rule of life, and a spiritual rule of life comes from purity ofheart and purity of heart from divine vision; Blessed are those who are pure in heart, for they will see God.' When, therefore, a monk labours, and afflicts himself because of the motion of evil thoughts, in order to prevent their remaining for a long time in his heart, and when after a considerable time his heart becomes pure, there remains disgust only therein, and it vexes the mind of the monk, and prevents his ascent to God, and cuts off his journeying to Him, and does not allow him to enjoy the vision of glory. Now when a monk works for a considerable time because of the motion of evil thoughts [in him], God has compassion upon his trouble, and not only does his heart become cleansed, and his soul pure from every thought of evil, but he is also held to be worthy of the sight of our Lord in a revelation of light, and henceforth, the devils never again dare to stir up evil thoughts in the heart of him that hath been esteemed worthy of this great thing. And should it happen that they dare so to do, they suffer pain and burn even as he suffers who is hot, and who kicks away with his feet the piercing goads of iron which glow with beat in the fire. During the interval between the beginning of the strife against evil thoughts and [the attainment of] purity of heart, the devils sometimes vex the monk, and sometimes are vexed by him, even as the blessed Evagrius said, 'It those who go down to the conflict afflict [others], they are themselves afflicted; so the devils afflict us, and they are also afflicted by us. They afflict us when we receive their evil thoughts, and they are afflicted by us when we, by means of prayer and wrath, hide (i.e., suppress) their thoughts. When, then, we labour and afflict ourselves for a considerable time in order that their thoughts may not tarry in us, we also afflict ourselves with labours and prayer so that they may not vex and hinder us by [their] violent motion, and afterwards power is given to us by our Lord to lift ourselves up upon the necks of our enemies, and thenceforward our heart rests and is at peace, not only from the perception of their thoughts, but from all the violence of their motion. And the peace and rest of God rule over our souls, and we see that there remains only the war which is manifest of the visions of devils until the time of death merely to terrify us, so that we may not be exalted [unduly] and destroy ourselves. And should it happen that the devils stir up thoughts in the heart of him that has been made perfect, straightway they become extinguished, even as fire is extinguished when water falls thereon.'", "saying_count": 29, "id": 1243, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers said, ' Why do the devils fear the labours of the monks, even as the Fathers say, ' If you wish the devils to be afraid of you, despise lusts?' The old man said, 'They are afraid because of three things, i. First. Because our Lord treated with contempt three kinds of passions, wherein are included and contained all the various classes of passions, and these are they: The love of the belly, the love of money, and vainglory. By means of these the Calumniator fought against our Redeemer, and through His constancy in the wilderness, and silent contemplation, and fasting, and prayer, He overcame Satan; therefore all the monks who travel in His footsteps, and who by means of fasting, and prayer, and silent contemplation, hideaway all the thoughts of sin, and who perform their labours in righteousness, our Lord makes to conquer by His strength, and He vanquishes the devils who are their enemies. And as the demons fear and tremble, not only by reason of the Crucifixion of Christ, but even at the sign of the Cross, wheresoever it be made apparent, whether it be depicted upon a garment, or whether it be made in the air, so also do the devils fear and tremble, not only by reason of the labours of our Lord and His constancy in the wilderness, but also at the existence of the monks in the wilderness, and at their silent contemplation, and their fasting, and their prayers, and their patient persistence in the performance of difficult labours, which take place for Christ's sake. Therefore on one occasion Abba Macarius said to Palladius, Speak to the devils which war against you with disgust, and sluggishness, and despair: if I had no labours of spiritual excellence, nevertheless for the sake of Christ I would guard these walls and His Name would be sufficient for the redemption of my life.

The old man said, 'Because the whole strength of the demon of fornication was discharged upon him, and he was, therefore, properly afraid. For those who have not with them this war in all its fierceness imagine that they have overcome it, but let them not boast themselves, and let them know the truth, that is to say, they have not vanquished the demon of fornication, and it is only that he has not waged war against them with all his strength, because he has not been permitted so to do, and he has not been permitted to do so because of their feebleness and laxity. For the war of fornication which comes upon a man only attacks him in the degree which he is able to bear. For, behold, the great and famous fathers who endured this war in all its severity for a long time were always in a state of fear and trepidation, as was also Abba Arsenius, who was a man eighty years old; and when the noble lady came to him and said, ' Remember me in your prayers,' he did not hesitate to say, ' I will pray to God that He may blot the remembrance of you out of my heart.' And by means of this which he spake, he put to shame the demon of fornication, and showed how great was the hatred for this unclean passion that wars against the holy men which he possessed.' [The story of Martinyana and the harlot is as follows: \u2014 There was a certain monk who dwelt in the desert, and whose name was Martinyana and he laboured in great works, and God worked by his hands many mighty deeds, and he was applauded by all men. Now when Satan, the Evil One, saw that he was greatly applauded he became bitterly angry, and he wished to distract and to withdraw him from his rule of life and ascetic labours. One day Satan saw that many folk were glorifying him, and he went and dwelt in a certain harlot, and he sent her to the blessed man in order to make him fall. So the harlot took her attire, and placed it in a bag, and went to the holy man, and when she arrived at his abode it was evening; and she knocked at the door and said, ' O Saint Martinyana, open the door to me, so that the wild beasts may not eat me.' Now the holy man thought that she was a phantom, and he rose up and prayed, and since meanwhile she ceased not to cry out, he rose up from his prayer, and opened the door to her, and said to her, 'Where come you to me, O devil?' And she said, ' [My] companions have forsaken me on the road, and I wandered about in the desert, and have arrived here'; and he left her [there], and went into the inner cell, and shut the door thereof between himself and her. And after the old man had laid down to sleep the harlot arrayed herself in her attire, and put on her ornaments, and then sat down; and when the morning had come, the old man went forth from his cell, and seeing her dressed he said to her, 'From where are you? What is your business?' And she said, 'I am a daughter of people of high degree, and my parents are dead, and they have left me great wealth. I heard that you wast a great man, and I have come to you, and I beg you to come to my house and take me to wife, and we will live on your excellence.' Then the old man said to her, 'How can I forsake my labour and my rule of life, and take you to wife, and fall from my covenant?' And she said to him, What sin is there in it? Did not Adam and all the Fathers take wives, and Noah, and Abraham, from whose seed Christ has risen?' Now by repeating these and suchlike things, she wellnigh succeeded in leading the holy man away captive, and he said to her, 'O woman, tarry a little so that I may see, lest peradventure some one may come and see us.' And having gone up to the roof to look, he woke up in his mind, and he made a flame of fire and stood up in it, and stayed in the fire until he burnt his toes; and when the harlot saw this, she fell down at his feet and wept, saying, ' I have sinned against God and you, 'and she revealed to him the whole truth, [saying], I repent.' And the holy man sent her to a nunnery, and he remained in his cell until his feet were healed of the burning of the fire. And after he was healed of his sickness, he rose up and went and dwelt in an island in the sea, where there were neither women nor men.]", "saying_count": 34, "id": 1248, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers said, 'What is the meaning of that which one of the old men said, ' If you see the wings of ravens flying about you will also see the prayer of him that is oppressed in mind being exalted?

And the old man said, ''What man who possesses riches will make himself poor?' Explain to us the meaning of the words of the holy man.' The old man said, 'The holy man calls admiration of God and purity [of soul]' that to which the blessed Mark gave the name 'meditation upon God' and atmosphere of freedom.' There are some brothers whose hearts become pure after labours and great strivings, and they become worthy of pure prayer, and their hearts also become illumined from time to time by the light of Divine Grace, and they attain to the meditation which is on God, and to the spiritual understandings which are superior to custom. The Fathers would not permit the men who attained to this capacity, when they were standing in the purity of soul of this nature, and in the atmosphere which was free from trouble, and when the beater struck the board, and the season for prayer arrived, to leave this enjoyable meditation, and to stand up and sing the Psalms, but they [allowed] them to remain therein until it had come to an end. For a man to sing the Psalms and to perform the service could always be found, but such meditation and such purity of the understanding, and the atmosphere of freedom could not at all times be acquired, and a man is neither able nor has the power to attain to this state whensoever he pleases, for it is again from heaven which is given by our Lord from time to time to him that is worthy thereof. For this reason one of the Fathers gave the following commandment: \u2014 If a man enjoys such meditation while he be standing up at the service, let him not interrupt it until it comes to an end, for such meditation fills the place of the service of the Psalms. See then that you drive not away from you the gift of God, and let your subservience (or submission) to the same stand firm; but it is right to know that certain brothers have not as yet attained to meditation of this kind. They have thought that these words were spoken for every man and for men of every kind of capacity, and although their minds have been illumined somewhat by the Psalms and prayers, they have relaxed the fulfilment of the canon of their service, wherein are placed their consolation, and their wages, and their profit, and have occupied themselves [with the meditation], but on several occasions they have been interrupted in the meditation which has come to them by the devils. It is, therefore, not right for the brothers who are beginners in the ascetic life to do this, but they should commit their life and works and meditation wholly to God, and if it should happen that this meditation comes to them, let them reveal the matter to one of the old men who is acquainted with such things, so that the demons may not lead them astray and work their destruction.'", "saying_count": 47, "id": 1261, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers said, 'By what means did the Fathers sing the Psalms of the Holy Spirit without wandering [of mind]?'

Each man did thus according to his capacity, whether he was engaged in a rule of life for the training of the body, or of the soul, or of the spirit, even as it is written, ' Blessed are the people who know your praises, O Lord, that is to say, blessed is the monk who, while glorifying you with praise, collects his mind from wandering, and understands clearly the knowledge and meaning of the Psalms of the spirit, even as it is written, ' Sing you to God with praise, sing you to our King.' When then a man sings the service in this manner, and pays attention to the meaning of the verse, he acquires daily the faculty of singing a song mingled with the meditation of God and with the gaze [which is fixed] upon Him. And after the time in which he hath arrived at the spiritual rule of life, immediately a monk hath begun to sing the Psalms, though one or two sections of them become too great for him, he is permitted to sing them with understanding and with the meditation which is on God, and he refrains from the customary Psalms, and he sings a song which is superior [to that of] body and flesh, and which is like to that of angels, even as the Fathers say.'", "saying_count": 48, "id": 1262, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers said, ' By means of what thoughts of excellence may the children of this world not be offended by the monks, when they see or hear concerning the stumblings (or lapses) which come upon them through the frailty of [their] nature, and from the wars of the devils?'

The old man said, 'It is well known to every man that in all the contests against sin and its lusts the labour of fasting is the first thing [to undertake], and it is so especially in the case of him that fights against the sin which is within him ; and the sign of the enmity against sin and its lusts becomes apparent in those who go down to this invisible conflict when they begin to fast. And next comes the rising up in the night, and whosoever loves the occupation of fasting all the days of his life is a friend of chastity. For as the pleasure of the belly, and the laxity caused by the sleep which incites to a polluted bed, are the head and chief of all the sins which are in the world, and all the abominations thereof, so fasting, and strict vigil in the fear of God, with the crucifying of the body throughout the night against the pleasures of sleep, are the foundation of the holy path of God, and of all the spiritual excellences. For fasting is the strengthener of all spiritual excellences, it is the beginning and end of the strife, and it is the foremost of all virtues; and as the enjoyment of the light cleaves closely to the eyes which are healthy, so does the desire for prayer cleave closely to the fasting [which is observed] with discernment. For as soon as a man has begun to fast, he desires greatly to converse with God in his mind. The body which is fasting cannot continue to lie on [its] bed the whole night, for fasting naturally incites to wakefulness towards God, not only by day, but also by night; for the empty body is not fatigued overmuch by its conflict with sleep, even though it be weak in the senses thereof, for its mind is towards God in supplication, and it is better for it to cease from labour through weakness than from the weights of meats. As long as the seals of fasting lie upon the mouth of man, his thoughts meditate upon repentance, and his heart makes prayers to arise; and mildness lies upon his countenance, and abominable motions are remote from him, and rejoicing never, in the smallest degree, appears in his forehead, for he is a foe of lusts and of unprofitable converse. The man who fasted regularly and with understanding, and whom abominable lust brought into subjection has never been seen, for fasting is the abode of all spiritual excellences, and he who holds it in contempt disturbs them all. Now, the first commandment which God laid down for our nature at the beginning gave [Adam] warning concerning the eating of food, and the head of our race fell through eating, therefore, at the point where the first corruption took place [in asceticism], must begin the building of the fear of God, when they lay down the first course for the observance of the law. And moreover when our Lord showed Himself at the Jordan He also began at this point, for after He was baptized the Spirit took Him out into the wilderness, and He fasted for forty days and forty nights; and all those who travel in His footsteps lay the beginning of their strife on this foundation. For who will treat with contempt, or hold lightly the armour which has been forged by God? If He Who laid down the law fasted, who is there among those who would keep the law that has not need thereof? Immediately this armour appears on a man straightway terror falls upon the thoughts of the chief of the rebellion, that is, Satan; and his power is shattered at the sight of the arms which our Captain of the host has placed in our hands, for as soon as he sees the might of this armour on a man he knows at once that he is ready for the contest. What armour is there which is as strong or which gives such boldness in the fight against evil spirits as hunger for the sake of Christ? For in proportion as a man is harried and brought low in his body, at the time when the phalanx of Satan surrounds him, does his heart support itself with confidence, and he who treats this with contempt is lax and is a coward in respect of other spiritual triumphs, because he has not upon him the armour whereby the divine athletes have gained the victory. And at the very beginning the sign of weakness appears in him, and he himself gives the opportunity of defeat to his adversary, and since he goes naked into the strife it is evident that he will emerge therefrom without victory, because he has cast away from him the strength which would stir up in him the divine zeal; for his members are not clothed with the flame of hunger, that is to say, fasting. As merchants cannot without labour and trouble save up riches, so the righteous man without anguish and labour for the sake of righteousness cannot expect the crown and the reward.

The old man said, 'When the brothers drew near to the Fathers and asked them questions [wishing] to learn concerning the mode of action and thought in respect of the wars of the devils, the Fathers did not persuade those among them who appeared to possess subtlety of thought, and intelligence, and understanding, and to hate the passions, and to be fervent in the spirit, to cast out from themselves straightway the thoughts of the passions whensoever they stirred in them, and to make them to depart foolishly, but they ordered them to tarry with them, and to examine carefully how they arose, and then to contend against them; for in proportion as they were trained in the knowledge of strivings and contendings against the passions and against devils they would benefit not themselves only, but many other people also. And in this wise acted also Evagrius, that man of understanding, and Abba Poemen, and others who were like to them. Therefore Abba Joseph said to Abba Poemen, ' When the passions rise up in you, give to and receive from them, and understand carefully their crafty nature, and train yourself to contend against them. Now there are certain weak and foolish brothers whom in no way whatsoever does it benefit to dally with the rise of the thoughts of the passions which are in the heart, on the contrary, it is far better for them, immediately they perceive the motions of the passions, to cast them forth from them by prayer, and with anger and hatred. Therefore, when several of the Fathers were gathered together and were discussing the conflicts of the thoughts, and whether it . was right to dally with them because of knowledge [concerning them], or to suppress them by means of prayer through fear [of them], one of the Fathers said, ' Even to understand the thoughts afar off is a great and excellent work, but it  is a far greater work, and one which makes a man to acquire practice, for him to understand the thoughts, and to wage war against them. When he has gained experience of their crafty character, then he will suppress them and make them to disappear by the power of prayer and humility. Now the meaning of this question is this. When a man has laboured in conflict and contest against the passions for a long time in seclusion, by the grace of our Lord his heart becomes purified, and rest and peace reign in his soul, and he has relief from tribulation, and he rejoices in God at all seasons, and the devils have no power henceforth to stir up evil thoughts in his soul, because his heart is filled with divine thoughts, and the understanding of spiritual things, and he is never without the mind which is in God, and the remembrance of His fear and mercy. And should the demons dare to stir up thoughts in him, they will not [succeed] in rousing those which cause anguish and which bring to naught spiritual excellences, but only those which are of an ordinary nature, and which impede the vision, even as Evagrius said.'

And the devil will never be gratified at the fulfilment of this passion by him, for there is nothing which will dry up the arteries, and prevent the accident of the night, and make a monk to possess chaste and quiet thoughts by day, so much as the restraining of the belly by thirst Some fast the whole day until the evening, and some fast for [several] nights at a time, yet when they break their fast and eat a little food, because they drink much water, they benefit in no wise by their fasting and by the sparing use of food which they practise because of the war of lust.

The old man said, 'The meaning of ' Flee from the children of men, and you will live,' is this: \u2014 If you wish to be delivered from the death which is in sin, and to live the perfect life which is in righteousness, leave your possessions, and family, and country, and depart into exile, that is, to the desert and mountains to the holy men; and cultivate with them My commandments, and you will live a life of grace. And the meaning of 'Flee, keep silence, and live a life of contemplation in silence' is this: \u2014 Since when you were in the world you wast drawn towards anxieties about the affairs thereof, I have made you to come out from the world, and I have sent you to the habitation of monks, so that after a short time of dwelling in the coenobium you may be drawn, first to the cultivation of My commandments openly, and secondly to contemplation in silence. And now that you are trained in the former sufficiently, you may flee, that is to say, get you forth from the monastery of the brothers, and enter into your cell, just as you did go forth from the world, and did enter into the monastery. And the meaning of 'Keep silence, and lead a life of contemplation in silence,' is: \u2014 Having entered into your cell to contemplate in silence, you shalt not give the multitude an opportunity of coming in to you, and talking to you unnecessarily, except on matters which relate to spiritual excellence; if you do not do this you will benefit by sitting in silent contemplation. For through the sight, and the hearing, and the converse of the multitude who will come in to you, the captivity of wandering thoughts will carry you off, and your silence and your contemplation will be disturbed. But do not imagine that the mere fact of having left the brothers in the monastery, or not bringing other men into your cell to be disturbed by them will be sufficient to make your mind to be composed, or to enable you to meditate upon God, and to correct yourself, unless you do take good heed not to occupy your mind with them in anyway whatsoever when they are remote from you. For until a man arrives at a state of impassibility, and overcomes by striving both the passions and the devils, whensoever a monk remembers any man in his cell, he remembers him in connexion with some passion, that is to say, with desire (or lust), or with anger, or with vainglory. And if it should happen that the mind wanders in respect of ordinary things (or means), unless he cuts them off from him, his wandering inclines through absolute necessity towards a remembrance which is allied to some passion. And it is also thus in the case of a neophyte, for whensoever during his contemplation in silence he remembered women he falls into the lust of fornication; and whensoever he remembers men, he is either wroth with them in his thoughts, and he makes accusations against them, and blames them, and condemns them, or he demands from them vainglory, and he inclines to passibility. Therefore when Abba Macarius was asked, 'What is the right way for a brother, who is a neophyte, to live in his cell?' he said, Let no monk when he is in his cell have any remembrance whatsoever of any man, for he cannot profit in any way in restraining his feelings from the conversation of men, except he take care to withhold his thoughts from secret intercourse with them.'

But the purity of heart which sees God, and to which our Lord ascribed blessing, saying, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God,' cannot be acquired without dwelling in the desert, and solitary and silent contemplation, and the monk must acquire it in the following way. First of all a man must go forth from the world, and dwell in a monastery, and after his training in a monastery and having gone into his cell, he must die through contemplation in silence, and through the other labours of his body, and through striving against the passions, and through conflict with devils. Then through the tranquility of mind [which he will acquire] in silent contemplation, he will remember his sins, and when he hates his passions, and has petitioned for the remission of his sins, and has suppressed his thoughts, and has become constant in pure prayer, and has cleansed his heart from odious thoughts, then will he be worthy to see in his heart, even as in a polished mirror, the light of the revelation of our Lord [shine] upon it, even as the Fathers say. Well, then, did that holy man say to those brothers, Visit the sick, reconcile the men of wrath, for he who cultivates spiritual excellences in the world cannot, by reason of the commotion of the affairs thereof, see his sins; but if he continue in silent contemplation and prayer he will see God.' 66l.

And because he was unaccustomed to feel comfortable in the presence of many folks, his mind began to wander about in remembering the brothers, and to meditate upon many things, and he was unable to find that dominant freedom for the continuous, secret prayer of the mind, which is superior to every influence that would make it decline, and is free from every [other] attraction, and he was, therefore, rightly grieved. Now one day, Abba Ammon went to visit him, and he saw that he was sorry about his coming from the desert, and he said to him, Father, it is not right for you to be sorrowful because you hast drawn near to the place where the brothers dwell, for your body has become feeble, and you are unable to perform those works wherein you were wont to labour in the desert.' Now when Abba Sisoes heard these things, he looked at Abba Ammon sternly, and he answered him with indignation, saying, 'What say you to me, Ammon? Was not the freedom of the thoughts which I had in the desert sufficient to take the place for me of all labours? And as regards yourself also, O Ammon, who are conscious of the life and acts of the freedom of the mind, and who are not subject to the constraint of wandering and disturbance of the mind, and who are not impeded by old age and infirmity, tell me what you are able to do in the desert at your great age? Even if I be unequal to the labours of the body, because I have become infirm through old age, I am better able to perform the labours of the mind than I was in the time of my early manhood. Or, perhaps in your opinion the clear shining of the mind, which a monk acquires by a life of contemplation in silence, and the constant intercourse with God, and the prayer which is without ceasing, and the remembrance of Christ, and the constant gazing 'upon Him, and the exultation of the soul in Him, and the favour of His love, and the affection for His commandments, and the desire for His good things, and the meditation upon His glory, and the thought about His excellence and His majesty, and the admiration of His humility, are matters which are small and contemptible? All these labours of the mind, and many others which are like to them, neither old age nor infirmity impedes, but they are prevented, and brought low, and, by degrees, are destroyed, by converse with the children of men, and by seeing many people, and by care about worldly affairs.

Today, however, in this generation, the same devils harass the monks, and drive them out of their cells by this war of departure, and therefore the great Fathers who have felt this war of wandering and of departure have said, ' There is no war which is more cruel to the monk than this; may Christ help us and deliver us from it.'

And because of this the fathers pursued after a life of contemplation in silence, lest when the wars of speaking and seeing and hearing were added to that which was already in their heart, they would fall by reason of their severity, even as actually happened on one occasion, for a woman came to the monks who were living a life of silent contemplation, and there was added to the war which was already in their hearts the wars of seeing, and hearing, and speaking, and they would have been vanquished by the severity thereof had it not been that the grace of our Lord supported them. That the war which takes place in the senses of the soul against the monks who live a life of silent contemplation is mightier and fiercer than that which takes place in the senses of the body, is well known from the words which the blessed Evagrius spake, saying, Against the monks who lead a life of silent contemplation the devils in person wage war, but against those who lead a life of spiritual excellence in a general assembly of brothers, the devils only stir up and incite the lazy brothers; but the war which arises from the sight, and the hearing, and the speech is much less fierce that that which is waged against the monks who dwell in silent solitude.

And he said to them, 'Although I was troubled, yet I said nothing.' What is the meaning of the words, 'Although I was troubled I spake not'?' The old man said, 'The perfection of monks consists of two parts, that is to say, of impassibility of the senses of the body, and of impassibility of the senses of the soul. Impassibility of the body takes place when a man who is reviled restrains himself for God's sake and speaks not, even though he be troubled; but impassibility of the soul takes place when a man is abused and reviled, and yet is not angry in his heart when he is abused, even like John Colobos. For on one occasion when the brothers were sitting with him, a man passed by and upbraided him, but he was not angry, and his countenance changed not ; then the brothers asked him, saying, are you not secretly troubled in your heart, O father, being reviled in this fashion?' And he answered and said to them, ' I am not troubled inwardly, for inwardly I am just as tranquil as you see that I am outwardly'; and this is perfect impassibility. Now at that time Abba Moses had not arrived at this state of perfection, and he confessed that although outwardly he was undisturbed, yet he was waging a contest in his heart, and he maintained silence and was not angry outwardly; and even this was a spiritual excellence, although it would have been a more perfect thing had he not been angry either inwardly or outwardly. And the blessed Nilus made a comparison of these two measures of excellence in the cases of the blessed men Moses and Aaron. The act of covering the breast and heart with the priestly tunic which Aaron performed when he went into the Holy of Holiesrepresented the state of a man who, though angry in his heart,suppresses his wrath by striving and prayer; and the stateof a man not being angry at all in the heart, because he hathbeen exalted to perfection by victory over the passionsand the devils, Nilus compared to that which is said of the blessed Moses, saying, ' Moses took the breast for an offering, because the soul dwells in the heart, and the heart in the breast.' And Solomon said, ' Remove anger from your heart,' and concerning Aaron the Book said, ' He was covering his breast with the ephod and tunic,' and this teaches us monks that it is meet for us to cover over the wrath which is in the heart with gentle, and humble, and tranquil thoughts, and that we should not allow it to ascend to the opening of our throat, and that the odiousness and abomination thereof will be revealed by the tongue.'", "saying_count": 78, "id": 1292, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers said, 'Why is it that, although all the fathers used to admonish the brothers to ask the old men questions continually, and to learn from them, and to reveal to them their thoughts, and to live according to their directions, one of the old men said to one of the brothers, 'Go, sit in your cell, and your cell will teach you everything'?

No man can serve two masters, and the soul cannot please God with spiritual excellence so long as the remembrances of corruptible things are in its mind, for the mind of the flesh is not able to please God; except the world dies out of the heart humility cannot live therein, and except the body be deprived of its lusts, the soul cannot be purified from thoughts.'", "saying_count": 111, "id": 1325, "tags": ["QA"]}, {"chapter_number": 18, "chapter_title": "Questions of the Brothers, and Answers of the Fathers, which are exceedingly fair and beautiful.", "saying": "The brothers said, ' Why is the mind disturbed at the meeting with females?'

' The old man said, ' Verily, all God's creatures are pure, through the Grace of Him that created them, yet, because sin obtained dominion, every one of them became polluted ; then came the advent of our Lord and abrogated sin, and righteousness obtained dominion, and everything became sanctified, whether it was in the heaven or on the earth. But because the blessed Fathers knew the harmful disposition of Satan, who even by means of such things as are used as food carries on a war to our injury, they sealed their foods with the holy sign of the Great Cross, that they might bring to naught all the crafts of the Calumniator. For one of the old men said, ' On one occasion, when I was lying down at night, I thirsted for water to drink. And there was near me a holy man who lived chastely, and he saw me take up a vessel of water to drink without having made over it the sign of the Cross. And he said to me, 'Wait, master, wait,' and he made the sign of the Cross over it, and straightway there fell from the vessel the Calumniator in the form of a flash of fire; and both he and I saw this, and we marvelled at the great power of the Redeemer, and at the wonderful sign of H is merit. ' Another version of the story reads: \u2014 And one of the Fathers said, On one occasion I was lying down at night, and I thirsted for water to drink. And there was near me a certain widow, who led a chaste life, both when she was with her husband, and afterwards, and she said to me, ' Wait, master, wait, and she made the sign of the Holy Cross over the vessel of water, and straightway the Calumniator fell from the vessel in the form of a flash of fire; and both she and I saw it, and we marvelled at the great power of our Redeemer, and at the wonderful sign of His merit. These things were indeed spoken by that holy mouth which was remote from falsehood. Therefore we must necessarily do this (i.e., make the sign of the Cross over our food) for the protection of our life. For against this holy woman who did these things, the enemy waged war openly, according to what I have learned from a certain saint, a chosen man of God, who heard the matter from her own mouth, and he spake thus: \u2014 The blessed woman spake to me, saying, One day I went to the house of God, and Satan drew nigh, and said to me, Why do you pray like a man, and say, Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost? And I said to him, If I am not to pray thus, how will I pray? And the blessed woman said, Satan said to me, Pray thus, and say, Glory be to you, O Mary, mother of Christ. Then I answered and said to him, [There are] ashes in your eyes, O Satan. Why should I forsake the Lord and adore the mother? And Satan disappeared. And the blessed man also said to me, This same old woman said to me: \u2014 On another occasion I went to church according to custom, and I knelt down and prayed, and then the Enemy came and made blind mine eyes, and I could not see, and I called to one of the women, and she led me to my house. After three days Satan departed from before mine eyes, and he began to go away from before me, and then I said to him, There is something which I must make you do. Go you to the place where you did seize upon me; and we went to the church, both he and I, and I left him where he seized upon me. Then I went away a short distance, and when I turned and looked at him I saw that he was standing like a shadow; and I went on again, and then turned, and still I saw him. And I shut the door of the temple and went forth, and then I opened it again and went in, and I saw him still standing [there], and at that time his wiles ceased from me. Such were the great things which happened to that blessed old woman. For the monk must not boast himself over the man who lives in the world, for there are mighty men in the world; for if such qualities are found in Eve, how much greater ones should be found in the Adam which is redeemed by Adam?' One of the Fathers said to me, 'One night while I was sleeping, the Enemy came and smote me, and said to me, 'Get you into the world and cultivate righteousness, for why do you shut yourself up like a beast in caves?' And knowing the wickedness of the Enemy, who was looking at me with an evil eye, I made the sign of the Cross in his face, and he fled from me. Then he waited a few days, and came and smote me on the neck, and said to me mockingly, 'Now you are a righteous man, rise up, and get you into the world, that I may not destroy you'; and having prayed, and made the sign of the Cross over my face, he departed from me. And a little while afterwards he came again, and sat upon my neck; then I made myself bold, and stood up, and made the sign of the Cross, the emblem of merit, before him, and again he disappeared, for he was unable to resist me. For all these things took place, and happened in very truth, and we may therefore know and understand that there is no rule of life in which God so much rejoices, or which is so terrible to the devils, and to all evil spirits, as the rule of humility, and penitence of mind, and the subjection of the body, and remoteness from the things which are seen. Whosoever despises these things will fall into the mire of the world; and whosoever holds in contempt the good riches of the fear of God, will have his hope of the inheritance of the saints cut off, and of the delights of heaven, which never pass away and never end. May we all be held worthy of these through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, the True God, to Whom, with His Father, and the Holy Spirit, be glory, now, and always, and for ever and ever! Amen.'' ", "saying_count": 115, "id": 1329, "tags": ["QA"]}]
